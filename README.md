This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


SWAPI, React and NextJS code test

Challenge:

Consume the Star Wars API (SWAPI) using React, NextJS and other JS technologies you deem fit.

Acceptance criteria

• Home screen contains a list of films pulled from the SWAPI
• List should be searchable
• Films can be favourited, this state should be persisted using local storage
• Favourited films should appear at the top of the list
• Favourited films can be unfavourited
• Film list items can be clicked to show individual film page
• Film page should exist on it’s own URL
• Film page should show all the information pulled from the SWAPI endpoint for an individual film
• The list of characters should display a tooltip when a list item is hovered, containing their name, birth year, eye colour, gender, hair colour and any other information you deem necessary
• Film page should contain a back to home link
• Provide public GitHub repo to source code
• Use SCSS for styling
• Use Flexbox or CSS grid for layouts - avoid Bootstrap etc
• Host the finished project on Vercel or similar
